AI can allow for technology to see and identify things, understand human language, make recommendations, and act independently of humans. Some of the most common uses for AI include customer service, fraud detection, personalized marketing, human resources and recruitment, application development, and predictive maintenance.</p>

    <p>Oftentimes, working with AI means upholding AI ethics, which is an AI discipline that deals with how to maximize the potential of AI while reducing the risk. Here are some values computer scientists consider while working with AI: explainability and interpretability, fairness and inclusion, robustness and security, accountability and transparency, and privacy and compliance.</p>
