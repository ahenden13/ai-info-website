    <p><a href="https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/application-of-ai-in-robotics/">Robotics</a> is a discipline of engineering and computer science that deals with the creation of machines that can carry-out programmable tasks. Robotics is an entirely separate field from Artificial Intelligence, but their overlap is significant and the application of AI techniques in robotics is becoming more and more prominent. This intersection is allowing for various industries to be born or be improved as it allows for an increase in productivity. Mainly, it allows for work tasks to be streamlined, whether routine jobs become automated or tedious jobs become more manageable. Opportunities for AI and robotics to advance a business are endless, and unique for every industry.</p>

    <p>The use of AI in robotics continues to grow in popularity. This is creating potential for increasing efficiency, improving safety, and expanding worker flexibility. AI is mainly applied to robotics through machine learning, where robots will copy human actions. Another way AI is utilized in robotics is via edge computing. With edge computing, data is processed close to the machine rather than the cloud so machines can have real-time responses. </p>
    <p>Some of the most common uses for AI and robotics today include customer service (chatbots), assembly (manufacturing), packaging, and imaging. As humans continue to interact with AI and the technology improves, the use of AI in robotics will continue to grow. </p>
