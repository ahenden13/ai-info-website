    <p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/what-is-machine-learning/">Machine Learning (ML)</a> refers to a subset of AI that aims to build systems that can learn from the data they recieve. In recent times, humans use devices with ML on a regular basis (e.g. facial recognition, social media, and email filtering). This technology is constantly changing as the algorithms behind these powerful machines continues to improve. There are two general approaches to ML algorithms:</p>

    <div class="row">
        <p><u>Supervised Machine Learning</u> - the more commonly used algorithm style. Computer scientists "supervise" the algorithm, directing how it should operate and what deductions to make. The algorithms rely on practice data sets with fixed output to learn.</p>
        <p><u>Unsupervised Machine Learning</u> - the more independent algorithm style. Algorithms are able to detect important patterns and functions without close human inspection. Contrary to supervised learning, these algorithms are improved by practicing with data sets that do not have predetermined output.</p>

    <p>The potential applications of Machine Learning are endless. Some common business uses for Machine Learning include customer lifetime value modeling (identifying valuable customers and how to retain them) and customer churn modeling (identifying which customers are likely to stop buying and why). Companies may also use Machine Learning for image classification, recommendations, predictions, and more.</p>
